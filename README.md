An experimental research methodology is used to study and visualize cause-and-effect relationships between random variables within Kaggle’s Titanic dataset. The dataset contains passenger traits such as survival, age, sex, or traveling class. The number of lifeboats were not sufficient to rescue everyone onboard leading to a “natural” selection process potentially encoded within the data. The EDA explores how passenger attributes are spread, distributed, and related, revealing interesting aspects about survival.
First, the feature space was cleaned and transformed, and missing values were imputed if applicable. Then, descriptive statistics were applied on selected random variables prior identifying patterns, studying relationships, and generating visual insights. Due to space limitations, only a few random variables were visualized and discussed in depth. Likewise, the extensive feature engineering potential of the dataset was not fully explored.
